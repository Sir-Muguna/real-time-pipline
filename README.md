## Building an End-to-End Real-Time Forex Price Streaming Data Pipeline

### Overview

This presentation outlines the steps to create a real-time streaming data pipeline using Docker, Apache Kafka, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), BigQuery, and Looker. The pipeline ingests, processes, and visualizes Forex data efficiently.

### Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion with Apache Kafka**
   - Kafka acts as the message broker, handling real-time data streams.
   - Producers send Forex data to Kafka topics.
   - Consumers read data from Kafka topics, process it, and store it in BigQuery.

2. **Data Processing and Storage with BigQuery**
   - Data is transformed and loaded into BigQuery for analysis.
   - BigQuery handles large-scale data processing and provides robust querying capabilities.

3. **Data Visualization with Looker**
   - Looker visualizes the processed data from BigQuery.
   - Dashboards and reports are created to provide insights into the Forex data.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Set Up Kafka Environment**
   - **Docker Setup:** Create a Docker Compose file to configure Kafka and Zookeeper containers.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     docker-compose up -d
     ```

2. **Create Kafka Topics**
   - Use Kafka CLI commands to create topics where data will be published and consumed.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics --create --topic forex_prices --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
     ```

3. **Set Up Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
   - **Create a Dataset and Table in BigQuery:**
     - Use the GCP Console to create a dataset and define a table schema that matches your data structure.
   - **Commands:**
     ```bash
     bq mk --dataset realtime_forex_pipeline
     bq mk --table realtime_forex_pipeline.forex_prices ticker:STRING,bid:FLOAT64,ask:FLOAT64,open:FLOAT64,low:FLOAT64,high:FLOAT64,changes:FLOAT64,date:TIMESTAMP
     ```

4. **Configure Data Ingestion**
   - **Producer Setup:** Develop and deploy a Kafka producer to send Forex data to Kafka topics.
   - **Consumer Setup:** Develop and deploy a Kafka consumer to process data and load it into BigQuery.

5. **Transform Data and Load into BigQuery**
   - **Consumer Script:** Reads data from Kafka, transforms it, and writes it to BigQuery using the BigQuery API.

6. **Set Up Looker for Data Visualization**
   - **Connect Looker to BigQuery:** Configure Looker to access your BigQuery dataset.
   - **Create Dashboards:** Build dashboards and visualizations to analyze and present Forex data.

### Running the Pipeline

1. **Start Docker Containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **Run Producer and Consumer Scripts**
   ```bash
   python /path/to/producer.py
   python /path/to/consumer.py
   ```

3. **Verify Data in BigQuery**
   - Use the BigQuery Console to query and validate the ingested data.

4. **Monitor Visualizations in Looker**
   - Access Looker and view the created dashboards and reports.

### Summary

This pipeline enables real-time data processing and visualization by integrating Kafka for data streaming, BigQuery for storage and processing, and Looker for data visualization. The system is scalable, robust, and designed for high-performance data analytics.
